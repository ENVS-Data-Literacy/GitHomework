At the end of this topic, you should be able to:  

 - Create your own repository on Github.  
 - Create a RStudio Project from that remote repository.
 - Understand the use of *commit*, *push*, and *pull* and how they sync to a remote repository.
 - Complete a homework where you'll have to edit some document and then push it back to the classroom repository.

# Assignment


You have also (apparently) already been able to access github classroom and download this repository. This is how all of the work in this class will be given and turned in, through [Dyerlab GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/7610458-environmental-data-literacy-2022). For each assignment:

1.  I will send out an invite to the repository (already did this if you are reading this)
2.  You will clone it to your computer and inside there will be:
    -   You can then read over the README file for a general overview and instructions.
    -   One or more activities will be described.
3.  You will complete these items.
4.  To turn in.  You will have to add any new documents and project files, perform a final *Commit* and then *Push* the change to back to GitHub. 

## Instructions

To see how this is going to work, you will need to make a new markdown document in RStudio (File -> New File -> Markdown File). Modify this new document as described below and then commit and push it back to me then we will have a little back-and-forth in this repository so you can see the feedback and revision process.

*Do this:*

1.  Add a the Title `# Github Homework` to the first line of the document
2.  Put your name on the second line.  Use the name you prefer to be called by.
3.  Under that, write your favorite color and movie.
4.  Add the file to git (Stage it)
5.  Commit these changes and make a comment in the commit that this is the version intended to be turned in.
6.  Push this repository back up to GitHub.
7.  I will make a comment on it (you'll be notified), and ask for one more thing.
8.  You'll then have to pull the changes I've made down to your computer, answer the question, and then commit and push it back up to GitHub.
